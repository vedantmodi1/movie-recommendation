# movie-recommendation

A recommendation system is a type of information filtering system which challenges to assume the priorities of a user, and make recommendations on the basis of userâ€™s priorities.

Two critically important methods are widely used for recommender systems. One is content-based filtering, where we attempt to shape the users preferences using data retrieved, and suggest items based on that profile. The other is collaborative filtering, where in we try to cluster alike users together and use data about the group to make recommendations to the customer.  
This uses the content recommender system.

### Objectives:
-  Pre-processing our given dataset to get rid of unnecessary data and prepare the dataset for prediction.
-  Visualization of our data to display various trends and observations.
-  To perform data mining in order to build an efficient movie and TV show 
recommendation system.

### Tools Used:
-   Jupyter Notebook 
-   Anaconda IDE 
-   Spyder 
-   Python 3.8 
-   Matplotlib.pyplot 
-   Seaborn 
-   Plotly Express 
-   Squarify Tree Map 
-   Pandas Profiling 

###  Data Pre-processing in a nutshell:
- Handling Missing Values
- Splitting the dataset into movies and TV shows
- Comparison of movies with TV shows 
- Separate analysis of movies and TV shows

### Data Mining in a nutshell:
- Preparation of Data for building the recommender system or prediction
- Building the recommender function 
- Create function to calculate confidence and association rule mining

### And a whole lot of visualization

## Algorithm Overview:
Step 1: Import the data 
Step 2: Check for missing values in the dataset 
Step 3: Handle the missing attributes 
Step 4: Perform Analysis on the dataset 
Step 5: Analyse Movies and Shows Separately 
Step 6: Begin Data Preparation for the model. 
Step 7: Combine the important attributes and create a new feature attribute. 
Step 8: Extract keywords 
Step 9: Implement the recommender function 
Step 10: Display the movie or show names.
